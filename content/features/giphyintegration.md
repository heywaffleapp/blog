We can now insert GIFs directly from the Image widget with our new Giphy integration.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Add a new Image widget.
2. Click on the Giphy icon.
3. Search for your desired GIF.
4. Select the GIF you want to insert.

With this integration, inserting images and GIFs is now easier than ever. We believe that Unsplash and Giphy are awesome libraries to find the images we need to make our boards come alive and look beautiful.

We use dozens of digital tools.

We open countless browser tabs every day.

We have several apps installed that we don't remember.

We have created accounts in every corner of the Internet.

We have files, folders, documents, links, photos and videos scattered _everywhere_, and _nowhere_ at the same time.

Our digital life is a mess.

We need a space to organize our lives' essentials in a single view.

Introducing **Waffle**, the visual organization app.

Imagine a bulletin board or a pegboard for your workspace, dedicated to organize your life. What would you hang or insert into it? Your to-do list, this month's calendar, sticky notes with upcoming appointments, and perhaps a habit tracker? Now, envision this concept as a digital app equipped with dynamic widgets, allowing you to arrange them freely and adjust their sizes at will.

Here are a few widget examples:

-   A _meals_ widget so you can plan your meals for tomorrow. Homemade pizza for dinner sounds good?
-   A _list_ widget so you don't miss any ingredientes needed for your pizza. Like the pineapple, right?
-   A _mood_ widget so you can express your current mood with an emoji 👨🏻‍🍳.
-   A _link_ widget so you don't lose the TikTok recipe your friend sent you last month.
-   A _weather_ widget so you grab a jacket before heading to buy the pepperoni you forgot on your first run to the grocery store.

**Waffle** is your new digital home. Home to all your essentials: to-do's, planners, lists, event reminders, notes, quotes, links.

For the past month, we've been working closely with our beta testers to ensure that Waffle is functional, useful, and ready to become your new digital homepage. We've gone through dozens of suggestions and comments, working quickly to fine-tune and tweak every single feature.

Today, we're thrilled to announce that **Waffle is available for early access**! We'll start inviting our first users from the waitlist. Don't worry if you're not in the first batch â€“ we'll be rolling out more invites in the coming weeks, so keep an eye on your inbox.

Thank you for being part of this journey with us. We can't wait to hear your feedback as you explore Waffle.

Some of our beta testers suggested that being able to resize widgets freely (apart from fixed sizes) would be a valuable feature. We tested this concept with the "Title" widget and loved the results!

Having the option to resize a Title can help us personalize our boards even more, allowing us separate the content with sections both vertically and horizontally, as well as blocks of columns or rows for multiple purposes.

We are rolling out this new feature today.

Have fun resizing!

Following our initial test of resizable widgets (see our post about [resizing titles](https://blog.heywaffle.app/updates/titleresizing)), we decided that the next addition to the family would be images.

Now you can resize your images freely, following the patterns of the grid. Just grab a new image widget from the bottom right corner and expand or shorten its size. The image inside will automatically adjust to the new size.

Have fun resizing!
